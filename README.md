# wolf3d
This game was written, using the ray casting technique, a 3D representation of a maze in which a player can find his/her way.
There is a file outside my sources called "map", where player can choose the size and the shape of labyrinth.
When game starts there is a start window and player should press  space to start a game.

Game features:<br/>
• Pressing ESC must close the window and quit the program cleanly.<br/>
• Clicking on the red cross on the window’s frame must close the window and quit
the program cleanly.<br/>
• The arrows on the keyboard must allow you to move in real time in the maze, like in the original game.<br/>
• Display different wall textures (the choice is yours) that vary depending on which compass point the wall is facing (North, South, East, West).<br/>

• Object collisions.<br/>
• Earning points by picking up objects.<br/>
