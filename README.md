# wolf3d
This game was written, using the ray casting technique, a 3D representation of a maze in which a player can find his/her way.
There is a file outside my sources called "map", where player can choose the size and the shape of labyrinth.
When game starts there is a start window and player should press  space to start a game.

Game features:
• Pressing ESC must close the window and quit the program cleanly.
• Clicking on the red cross on the window’s frame must close the window and quit
the program cleanly.
• The arrows on the keyboard must allow you to move in real time in the maze, like in the original game.
• Display different wall textures (the choice is yours) that vary depending on which compass point the wall is facing (North, South, East, West).
• Wall collisions.
• Floor and ceiling texture.
• Object collisions.
• Earning points by picking up objects.
• Doors can open.
• Secret doors.
• Sounds and music.
